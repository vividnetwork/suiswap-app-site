The SSWP token symbolizes the Suiswap protocol token, a native token within the SUI blockchain ecosystem. 
The purpose of the SSWP token is to strengthen the Suiswap protocol, platform, and governance mechanisms. 
Suiswap aspires to establish itself as the premier trading platform for the entire SUI network, offering liquidity for various swaps and transactions. 
As the governance token of Suiswap, the SSWP token constitutes an essential component of the platform's operation.

1. **The Suiswap platform intends to enable community members to derive revenue rights through the SSWP token**: By holding and staking platform tokens on the platform, community members can obtain platform revenue generated from trading fees and other channels via SSWP tokens.

2. **The Suiswap platform seeks to facilitate the distribution of platform management rights among community members holding SSWP tokens**: By staking tokens, members can contribute valuable insights and influence the future trajectory of the platform's development. 

## The Value of SSWP

The SSWP token is the core of all trading and management on the Suiswap platform, and SSWP holders can have the following rights:

1. **Platform Revenue**: We will distribute approximately 60% of the platform revenue evenly among SSWP token holders. All you need to do is lock your SSWP on the Suiswap platform, and you can receive the corresponding platform revenue every 14 days without unlocking your tokens.

2. **Platform Governance**: By staking your tokens through SUI blockchain-based smart contracts, you can govern the SUI platform and community.

3. **Yield Farming**: By locking your SSWP on the Suiswap platform, you can earn additional SSWP rewards when you unlock your tokens.

4. **Trading, Holding, and Circulation**: Like other tokens, unlocked SSWP tokens can be traded, held, and circulated on the blockchain.

## SSWP Automatic Token Burn Mechanism

**The Suiswap platform will automatically use a portion of its platform revenue to automatically buy back SSWP tokens from the market and permanently destroy them.**

This means that the number of SSWP tokens will gradually decrease over time. By progressively reducing market liquidity, we give SSWP tokens the incentive to continually increase in value, encouraging our users to hold SSWP tokens for the long term.

## SSWP Specifications

**The total supply of SSWP tokens is capped at 10 billion**, ensuring that the maximum number of tokens in circulation will never exceed this limit.

These tokens will be distributed among community members, early-stage investors, IDO participants, liquidity providers, the Suiswap team, and advisors according to various locking and vesting schemes delineated in a subsequent table and chart.

The protocol will generate the initial batch of SSWP tokens following the launch of the Suiswap mainnet through a series of token events:

##### 1. Initial SSWP Liquidity Pool

A small number of SSWP tokens will be allocated to the Suiswap `SSWP/SUI` liquidity trading pool immediately after the platform's mainnet launch. 

This limited supply of SSWP tokens will primarily be used to determine token pricing during subsequent IDO events and to enable community members to engage with the ecosystem and features that rely on SSWP tokens (such as platform revenue acquisition and yield farming). 
The `SSWP/SUI` pool will provide reference pricing for SSWP tokens in future IDO events.

##### 2. Initial Liquidity Rewards Event

**Suiswap will host a two-month initial liquidity rewards event after the mainnet launch to incentivize users to provide liquidity to the Suiswap protocol.**
Users can obtain Suiswap tokens by providing liquidity to pools such as `SUI/USDC`, `SUI/USDT`, and `USDC/USDT`, etc. 

These SSWP tokens will be allocated to:
- The first users to provide liquidity.
- Weighted distribution according to the value of the liquidity provided.
- Random participants distribution. These SSWP tokens will be randomly distributed to some participating community members who provides liquidity during the events.

##### 3. IDO

Community members can purchase SSWP tokens through the Suiswap token IDO event. 
**The IDO will be held approximately one month after the Suiswap mainnet launch.** 
Members can buy SSWP tokens using the SUI token during the IDO event.

##### 4. Airdrop

The airdrop event will be held after the IDO event concludes. 
Suiswap community members with OG roles or those who have accumulated Suiswap points will be eligible to receive the airdrop. 
We will snapshots all member's Suiswap Points at the end of the IDO and distribute airdropped SSWP tokens proportionally based on the number of points. 
The airdrop token amount is set to 2%~3.5% and will be dynamically adjusted based on the tokens left in the private sale.

##### 5. Private Sale, Seed Round

These tokens will be given to early Suiswap investors. 
The maximum token supply ratio for early investors is set to 13.5%. 
All leftover tokens will be reallocated to the IDO, airdrop, and Suiswap partners.

##### 6. Liquidity Mining

After the "Initial Liquidity Rewards Event" we will implement long-term liquidity mining activities. 
A portion of SSWP will be allocated to corresponding trading pools daily. 
You can earn SSWP rewards by providing consistent liquidity to these pools.

##### 7. Yield Farming

After the Suiswap mainnet launch, you can lock and stake Suiswap tokens on the Suiswap platform to earn a fixed APR return. 
You will receive staking rewards once your tokens are unlocked.

## Conclusion

The SSWP plays a crucial role in the Suiswap ecosystem, a decentralized exchange built on the innovative SUI blockchain. 
As a governance token, SSWP enables its holders to participate in platform governance, enjoy platform revenue, and engage in yield farming and liquidity mining activities. 
With a fixed supply of 10 billion SSWP tokens and a token burn mechanism, SSWP is designed to maintain a stable growth in value and incentivize long-term holding.

The Suiswap platform offers a variety of token events, such as the initial liquidity rewards event, IDO, airdrops, private sales, and seed rounds, to distribute SSWP tokens and encourage community engagement. 
By actively participating in these events and providing liquidity to the platform, community members can benefit from the growth and success of the Suiswap ecosystem.

As SUI continues to develop and strengthen its blockchain technology, focusing on speed and security, Suiswap's potential as a leading decentralized exchange also increases. 
The SSWP token will remain at the core of the Suiswap platform, empowering its users and shaping the future of decentralized finance.
