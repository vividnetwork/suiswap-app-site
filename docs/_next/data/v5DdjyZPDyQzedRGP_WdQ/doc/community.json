This event allows any community member with Suiswap Points to participate in the airdrop by entering the `/airdrop` command in the dedicated `#suiswap-points` channel.\n\nThe primary purpose of this Testnet Airdrop is to act as a trial run before the Mainnet Airdrop and distribute our **SSWP** governance tokens to our valued community members. \n\nThese tokens will enable participation in various activities, including liquidity mining, staking to earn platform rewards, and future governance proposals.\n\n## Step-by-Step Participation Guide:\n\n1. Verify that you have successfully linked your wallet address. If not, you can still use the `/link-address` command to link your preferred wallet address.\n\n![suiswap-testnet-airdrop-link-address](/doc/images/suiswap-testnet-airdrop-link-address.png)\n\n2. Ensure that you possess an adequate amount of Suiswap Points, as your airdrop allocation will be calculated based on your Suiswap Points balance. Use slash command `/suiswap-points` to query your Suiswap Points.\n\n![suiswap-testnet-airdrop-suiswap-points-query {maxWidth:400px} {center:true}](/doc/images/suiswap-testnet-airdrop-suiswap-points-query.png)\n\n3. Make sure you have a sufficient balance of SUI tokens to cover the gas fees associated with the airdrop transaction.\n\n4. In the `#suiswap-points` channel, send the `/airdrop` slash command, and our automated bot will provide you with your unique airdrop secret.\n\n![suiswap-airdrop-slash-command](/doc/images/suiswap-airdrop-slash-command.png)\n\n5. To claim your **SSWP** tokens, paste your airdrop secret at \"https://suiswap.app/community/suiswap-points\".\n\n![suiswap-airdrop-paste-secrect {maxWidth:400px} {center:true}](/doc/images/suiswap-airdrop-paste-secrect.png)\n\n## Essential Points to Consider:\n\n### 1. Airdrop Calculation and Distribution\n\nWe would like to emphasize that the current growth and uncertainty of Suiswap Points for each community member cannot be accurately determined. **Airdrops conducted on the Testnet will be calculated by simply dividing your current Suiswap Points by 10. The Mainnet airdrop will adhere to a strict calculation based on each community member's Suiswap Points balance and the total airdrop allocation.**\n\n### 2. Future SSWP-based Features\n\n**In the coming days, we will be introducing more SSWP-based features, such as liquidity mining, staking to earn platform rewards, and other exciting opportunities**. We encourage you to hold onto your airdropped tokens and explore the full potential of our platform using the SSWP tokens you receive.\n\n### 3. Importance of Unique Secrets\n\nPlease refrain from attempting to copy someone else's secret, as it will be ineffective. **You can only claim the airdrop using the wallet you have linked and the specific secret assigned to you.** If your wallet address and secret do not match (e.g., when attempting to copy someone else's secret), your transaction will fail.\n\n### 3. One-time Secret and Airdrop Claim\n\n**To prevent potential abuse, your secret will be sent only once, and you can use that secret to claim the airdrop one time.** If you try to claim the airdrop twice using the same secret, subsequent transactions will be unsuccessful."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
