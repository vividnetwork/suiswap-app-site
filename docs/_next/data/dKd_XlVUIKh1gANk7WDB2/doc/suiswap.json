It aims to provide a secure, fast, and agile trading environment for the SUI ecosystem. In this article, we will provide an in-depth look at Suiswap, its key components, and the overall vision of the platform.\n\n## Background\n\nThe name Suiswap is derived from the combination of \"Sui\" (the name of the blockchain) and \"Swap\" (token trading). Taking advantage of the fast and secure nature of the SUI blockchain, Suiswap's primary goal is to offer a decentralized, rapid, and secure token trading platform for the SUI blockchain. Additionally, it aims to build a foundational infrastructure for token trading for other protocols built on top of SUI.\n\nSuiswap hopes to provide the entire SUI community with a decentralized, fast token exchange or order book-based trading platform. Specifically, Suiswap's main components will consist of the following:\n\n1. Decentralized token exchange built on traditional liquidity pools, similar to [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)'s SUI/USDC.\n2. Decentralized token exchange based on stablecoin liquidity pools, similar to [Curve](https://curve.fi/)'s USDC/USDT.\n3. Central limit order book trading platform.\n4. Decentralized aggregator built on the above three points, aggregating liquidity from order books and liquidity pools to provide greater liquidity and lower slippage.\n5. Liquidity farming to earn platform tokens (SSWP) by providing liquidity.\n6. Yield farming and platform revenue acquisition through staking platform tokens.\n\nThe vision is to provide a unified platform for trading (Trade) and exchanging (Swap) infrastructure for the entire SUI ecosystem and empower other platform protocols based on this foundation.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Traditional Liquidity Pools\n\nSimilar to [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), Suiswap will offer decentralized token exchange built on traditional liquidity pools. Users can trade tokens like SUI/USDC in a permissionless and decentralized manner. Liquidity providers (LPs) can contribute assets to the pool, earning a portion of the trading fees generated by the platform.\n\n### 2. Stablecoin Liquidity Pools\n\nSuiswap will also feature stablecoin liquidity pools, akin to [Curve](https://curve.fi/)'s USDC/USDT pools. These pools provide lower slippage and tighter spreads when trading stablecoins, making them an attractive option for traders and LPs alike.\n\n### 3. Central Limit Order Book Trading Platform\n\nTo cater to more sophisticated traders, Suiswap will include a central limit order book (CLOB) trading platform. This component allows users to place limit orders, offering more control over their trades and potentially better prices compared to automated market makers (AMMs).\n\n### 4. Decentralized Aggregator\n\nThe decentralized aggregator is a crucial component of Suiswap, combining liquidity from order books and liquidity pools to provide greater liquidity and lower slippage for traders. By aggregating multiple sources of liquidity, Suiswap aims to offer a more efficient and seamless trading experience.\n\n### 5. Liquidity Farming\n\nUsers who provide liquidity to Suiswap's pools will be able to participate in liquidity farming, earning SSWP tokens as a reward. This incentive mechanism aims to attract more users to the platform, increasing liquidity and improving the overall trading experience.\n\n### 6. Yield Farming and Platform Revenue\n\nStaking SSWP tokens will enable users to participate in yield farming and gain a share of the platform's revenue. This feature offers\n\nadditional incentives for users to hold and use SSWP tokens, further supporting the growth of the Suiswap ecosystem.\n\n## Vision and Future Development\n\nSuiswap aims to provide a unified trading and exchanging infrastructure for the entire SUI ecosystem by offering a comprehensive platform that caters to various user needs. By empowering other platform protocols built on the SUI blockchain, Suiswap strives to become the go-to solution for token trading within the SUI community.\n\nThe future development of Suiswap will focus on expanding the platform's offerings and continuously refining the user experience. Some potential areas of growth include:\n\n1. **Cross-chain integration**: Integrating with other blockchain networks will enable Suiswap to tap into a broader user base and facilitate cross-chain asset transfers, further solidifying its position as a leading trading platform.\n\n2. **New financial products**: Expanding Suiswap's product offerings to include more advanced financial instruments, such as options and derivatives, will cater to a wider range of traders and investors.\n\n3. **Enhanced user experience**: Continuously refining the platform's interface and functionality will ensure that users have a seamless and efficient trading experience.\n\n4. **Community governance**: Implementing a community governance model will enable Suiswap governance token holders to have a say in the future development and direction of the platform, promoting a more decentralized and community-driven ecosystem.\n\n5. **Partnerships and integrations**: Collaborating with other projects and platforms within the SUI ecosystem will strengthen the overall network and increase the utility of the Suiswap platform.\n\nSuiswap is a promising decentralized token trading platform and exchange built on the SUI blockchain. By offering a comprehensive suite of trading tools, including traditional liquidity pools, stablecoin liquidity pools, a central limit order book trading platform, and a decentralized aggregator, Suiswap aims to cater to a wide range of user needs.\n\nThe platform's focus on liquidity farming and yield farming offers attractive incentives for users to participate in and support the growth of the Suiswap ecosystem. With a clear vision and a robust foundation, Suiswap is well-positioned to become a leading trading platform within the SUI community and beyond.\n\n## Useful Link \n\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/suiswap)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/suiswap_app)\n- [Crew3 / Zealy](https://zealy.io/c/suiswap-app/questboard)"},{"article":{"time":"2023-05-08","name":"suiswap-tokenomics","nameShow":"🌟· Suiswap Tokenomics","description":"The SSWP token symbolizes the Suiswap protocol token, a native token within the SUI blockchain ecosystem.

All you need to do is lock your SSWP on the Suiswap platform, and you can receive the corresponding platform revenue every 14 days without unlocking your tokens.\n\n2. **Platform Governance**: By staking your tokens through SUI blockchain-based smart contracts, you can govern the SUI platform and community.\n\n3. **Yield Farming**: By locking your SSWP on the Suiswap platform, you can earn additional SSWP rewards when you unlock your tokens.\n\n4. **Trading, Holding, and Circulation**: Like other tokens, unlocked SSWP tokens can be traded, held, and circulated on the blockchain.\n\n## SSWP Automatic Token Burn Mechanism\n\n**The Suiswap platform will automatically use a portion of its platform revenue to automatically buy back SSWP tokens from the market and permanently destroy them.**\n\nThis means that the number of SSWP tokens will gradually decrease over time. By progressively reducing market liquidity, we give SSWP tokens the incentive to continually increase in value, encouraging our users to hold SSWP tokens for the long term.\n\n## SSWP Specifications\n\n**The total supply of SSWP tokens is capped at 10 billion**, ensuring that the maximum number of tokens in circulation will never exceed this limit.\n\nThese tokens will be distributed among community members, early-stage investors, IDO participants, liquidity providers, the Suiswap team, and advisors according to various locking and vesting schemes delineated in a subsequent table and chart.\n\nThe protocol will generate the initial batch of SSWP tokens following the launch of the Suiswap mainnet through a series of token events:\n\n##### 1. Initial SSWP Liquidity Pool\n\nA small number of SSWP tokens will be allocated to the Suiswap `SSWP/SUI` liquidity trading pool immediately after the platform's mainnet launch. \n\nThis limited supply of SSWP tokens will primarily be used to determine token pricing during subsequent IDO events and to enable community members to engage with the ecosystem and features that rely on SSWP tokens (such as platform revenue acquisition and yield farming). \nThe `SSWP/SUI` pool will provide reference pricing for SSWP tokens in future IDO events.\n\n##### 2. Initial Liquidity Rewards Event\n\n**Suiswap will host a two-month initial liquidity rewards event after the mainnet launch to incentivize users to provide liquidity to the Suiswap protocol.**\nUsers can obtain Suiswap tokens by providing liquidity to pools such as `SUI/USDC`, `SUI/USDT`, and `USDC/USDT`, etc. \n\nThese SSWP tokens will be allocated to:\n- The first users to provide liquidity.\n- Weighted distribution according to the value of the liquidity provided.\n- Random participants distribution. These SSWP tokens will be randomly distributed to some participating community members who provides liquidity during the events.\n\n![suiswap-tokenomics-allocation {maxWidth:min(100%, 450px)} {caption:5375697377617020546f6b656e6f6d69637320416c6c6f636174696f6e}](/doc/images/suiswap-tokenomics-allocation.png)\n\n##### 3. IDO\n\nCommunity members can purchase SSWP tokens through the Suiswap token IDO event. \n**The IDO will be held approximately one month after the Suiswap mainnet launch.** \nMembers can buy SSWP tokens using the SUI token during the IDO event.\n\n##### 4. Airdrop\n\nThe airdrop event will be held after the IDO event concludes. \nSuiswap community members with OG roles or those who have accumulated Suiswap points will be eligible to receive the airdrop. \nWe will snapshots all member's Suiswap Points at the end of the IDO and distribute airdropped SSWP tokens proportionally based on the number of points. \nThe airdrop token amount is set to 2%~3.5% and will be dynamically adjusted based on the tokens left in the private sale.\n\n##### 5. Private Sale, Seed Round\n\nThese tokens will be given to early Suiswap investors. \nThe maximum token supply ratio for early investors is set to 13.5%. \nAll leftover tokens will be reallocated to the IDO, airdrop, and Suiswap partners.\n\n##### 6. Liquidity Mining\n\nAfter the \"Initial Liquidity Rewards Event\" we will implement long-term liquidity mining activities. \nA portion of SSWP will be allocated to corresponding trading pools daily. \nYou can earn SSWP rewards by providing consistent liquidity to these pools.\n\n##### 7. Yield Farming\n\nAfter the Suiswap mainnet launch, you can lock and stake Suiswap tokens on the Suiswap platform to earn a fixed APR return. \nYou will receive staking rewards once your tokens are unlocked.\n\n![suiswap-token-allocation-timeline {maxWidth:min(100%, 500px)} {caption:5353575020546f6b656e2043697263756c6174696f6e205363686564756c65}](/doc/images/suiswap-token-allocation-timeline.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe SSWP plays a crucial role in the Suiswap ecosystem, a decentralized exchange built on the innovative SUI blockchain. \nAs a governance token, SSWP enables its holders to participate in platform governance, enjoy platform revenue, and engage in yield farming and liquidity mining activities. \nWith a fixed supply of 10 billion SSWP tokens and a token burn mechanism, SSWP is designed to maintain a stable growth in value and incentivize long-term holding.\n\nThe Suiswap platform offers a variety of token events, such as the initial liquidity rewards event, IDO, airdrops, private sales, and seed rounds, to distribute SSWP tokens and encourage community engagement. \nBy actively participating in these events and providing liquidity to the platform, community members can benefit from the growth and success of the Suiswap ecosystem.\n\nAs SUI continues to develop and strengthen its blockchain technology, focusing on speed and security, Suiswap's potential as a leading decentralized exchange also increases. \nThe SSWP token will remain at the core of the Suiswap platform, empowering its users and shaping the future of decentralized finance."},{"article":{"time":"2023-05-10","name":"suiswap-token-staking","nameShow":"✨· Suiswap Token Staking","description":"Boost your earnings with Suiswap Token (SSWP) staking and yield farming, leveraging platform dividends and additional SSWP rewards for higher returns.","markdownPath":"/doc/articles/suiswap-token-staking.md","cover":"/doc/cover/suiswap-token-staking-cover.jpg","thumbnailImage":"/doc/cover/suiswap-token-staking-cover.jpg"},"section":{"section":"suiswap","sectionShow":"Suiswap","articles":[{"time":"2023-04-24","name":"introduction-to-suiswap","nameShow":"💡· Introduction To Suiswap","description":"Suiswap is a decentralized token trading platform and exchange built on the SUI blockchain by Vivid Network.

In this article, we will explain in detail how SSWP token holders can participate in platform revenue sharing, staking, yield farming, and other related benefits.\n\n\n## Platform Revenue Sharing\n\nWe will collect approximately 60% of the platform's revenue every 14 days and return this portion of the revenue to users as dividends on the 15th day. We call each 14-day period an earning cycle. Earning cycles on the Suiswap mainnet are set to 14 days, meaning that users who stake their SSWP tokens can claim their share of the platform's 60% revenue every two weeks. In testnet, earning cycles are set to one day.\n\n**Users who stake their tokens before the start of the next earning cycle have the right to claim dividends from the current earning cycle, and your share of dividends depends on your staked SSWP amount multiplied by your Boost value (see below).**\n\n> #### Example\n>\n> For example, if the first earning cycle on the Suiswap mainnet runs from March 1st to March 14th, and the second earning cycle from March 15th to March 28th, approximately 60% of the revenue generated between March 1st and March 14th will be collected. \n>\n> At the start of the second earning cycle (March 15th), the dividends from the first earning cycle (March 1st to March 14th) will be distributed to users who staked their tokens on the platform before March 15th. Users who stake their tokens on or after March 15th will not be eligible for dividends from the first earning cycle.\n>\n> At the start of the third Earning Cycle (March 29th), users who staked their tokens before March 29th can claim dividends from the second Earning Cycle (March 15th to March 28th), and so on.\n\n\n\n## Staking\n\nWhen you stake your SSWP tokens, you can choose your lockup period. During this time, your SSWP tokens will be locked in a smart contract and cannot be withdrawn. Locked tokens can be used for:\n\n1. Claiming platform dividends\n2. Yield Farming: Earning additional, stable SSWP rewards after the lockup period ends.\n\n**The longer your lockup period, the higher your share of platform revenue and additional SSWP rewards with higher APR.** Specifically, your lockup period will affect two factors: \n\n- Boost value \n\n- Additional SSWP rewards.\n\n  \n\n### Boost Value\n\nBoost acts as an additional multiplier that is used to calculate your share of platform revenue, with values typically ranging from 1.0 to 7.0, depending on the length of your staking period. The longer you stake your tokens, the higher your boost value.\n\nYour dividend reward share will be calculated based on **your staked token amount multiplied by your oost value**. For example, staking 1000 SSWP tokens with a boost value of 2.0 will yield the same dividend rewards as staking 2000 SSWP tokens with a boost value of 1.0.\n\n\n\n### Yield Farming\n\nWhen you stake SSWP tokens on the Suiswap platform, the platform will grant additional SSWP tokens based on your staked amount when you unlock your tokens. This allows you to earn stable, additional rewards simply by staking.\n\nYour additional SSWP rewards depend on your staked amount and staking period. With the same staked SSWP amount, the longer your staking period, the higher your APR, and the more additional SSWP rewards you will receive when unlocking your tokens.\n\n> ##### Note\n>\n> **Please note that this does not mean the total circulating supply of SSWP will increase over time.** \n>\n> Since the total circulating supply of SSWP tokens is fixed upon the launch of Suiswap, a portion of SSWP tokens will be pre-allocated for staking rewards. Once this pre-allocated portion is exhausted, you will no longer receive additional rewards from staking SSWP. However, you can still extend your staking period to increase your Boost value.\n\n\n\n## How to Stake\n\n1.  Visit the [Suiswap app](https://suiswap.app/) and navigate to the \"Suiswap Token\" tab.\n\n2. In the `Suiswap Token` tab, you can view your total SSWP token holdings, their corresponding market value, and the current amount of SSWP tokens you hold and have staked.\n\n![sswp-token-panel {center:true} {maxWidth:100%}](/doc/images/sswp-token-panel.png)\n\n3. Click the `Stake` button in the Suiswap Token tab to start staking your SSWP tokens. In the pop-up interaction panel, you can choose the amount of tokens to stake and the staking period.\n\n4. The staking panel will prompt you to select the amount to stake and the lockup period. After selecting the given lockup period, you can see your boost value and the estimated additional SSWP rewards and APR for the current lockup period.\n\n![sswp-stake-info {center:true} {maxWidth:100%}](/doc/images/sswp-stake-info.png)\n\n5. After selecting the staking amount and period, click the `Stake` button in the panel to submit a staking request to the smart contract deployed on the blockchain.\n\n6. After completing the request, you will see your staking information under the Suiswap Token tab. You can stake multiple times, but since you will stake different SSWP tokens at different times and their lockup periods may vary, each staking action will generate a separate staking information panel, and their dividends and rewards will be calculated separately.\n\n![sswp-stake-info-panel {center:true} {maxWidth:100%}](/doc/images/sswp-stake-info-panel.png)\n\n7. You can select one of the staking information panels and click the `Claim Reward` button to claim platform revenue or the `Unlock` button to unlock the staked SSWP.\n\n8. When you select `Claim Reward`, a claim-reward\" interaction panel will pop up, listing your dividend earnings for each liquidity pool during the current earning cycle.\n\n![sswp-claim-reward-success {center:true} {maxWidth:100%}](/doc/images/sswp-claim-reward-success.png)\n\n9. Click the `Claim` button to claim all dividend earnings, completing the dividend claim for the current earning cycle.\n\n10. You may encounter situations where the `Claim` button is not clickable, which is primarily due to one of the following reasons:\n\n    - You have already claimed your dividend earnings for the current earning cycle and cannot claim them again. You must wait for the next Earning Cycle.\n\n    - The current earning cycle has not ended, and you must wait for the next earning cycle to begin before you can claim dividends from the previous earning cycle.\n\n![sswp-claim-rewrad-failed {center:true} {maxWidth:100%}](/doc/images/sswp-claim-rewrad-failed.png)\n\nIn conclusion, staking SSWP tokens on the Suiswap platform allows users to participate in platform revenue sharing and yield farming, providing additional benefits and rewards to SSWP token holders. By carefully selecting your staking period and amount, you can maximize your potential earnings from the Suiswap platform."},{"article":{"time":"2023-05-11","name":"suiswap-initial-liquidity-reward","nameShow":"🎉· Suiswap Initial Liquidity Reward","description":"A 2-month event aims to incentivize users to provide liquidity to the pools on Suiswap's for a lock-up duration of over three months.

The remaining 337,500,000 million tokens will be distributed based on a weighted allocation of your liquidity value and lock-up duration.\n\n\n\n## Participation rules for the event:\n\n1. You need to provide liquidity in the **SUI/USDC, SUI/USDT, and USDC/USDT** pools on the Suiswap mainnet.\n2. **Your liquidity provision lock-up time must exceed 3 months.**\n\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n###### 1. Does participating in this event mean I spend this amount of money to get rewards?\n\nOf course not.\n\nYou can withdraw your liquidity amount after the lock-up period. At the same time, since you are providing liquidity for all transactions on the Suiswap platform, you can receive liquidity rewards (i.e., a 0.25% transaction fee for each trade, but beware of [impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) caused by price changes).\n\nSpecifically, by providing liquidity for three months or more, you can receive after the lock-up period:\n\n1. Withdraw your tokens (the ratio of the two will change with price fluctuations).\n2. The profits you made from platform transaction fees during the lock-up period.\n3. **SSWP tokens from this event**.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n###### 2. Can I receive rewards from Events 1 to 5 simultaneously?\n\nYes, since the statistical methods for each event are different. You can receive rewards for Events 1 to 4 by providing liquidity only once.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n###### 3. How is my liquidity value calculated?\n\nYour liquidity value depends solely on the value of the tokens when you provide liquidity, and the values of USDC and USDT are both considered to be \\$1.0.\n\nFor example, if you provided 1,000 SUI tokens and 1,500 USDC when the SUI price was \\$1.5, your liquidity value would be equivalent to \\$3,000. After the event, if the value of SUI changes to \\$1.2, your liquidity value **will not** be recalculated and will still be considered as \\$3,000.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n###### 4. How is the time sequence for Events 1, 2, and 3 determined?\n\nIn Events 1, 2, and 3, we will sort all users' liquidity-providing transactions in `SUI/USDC`, `SUI/USDT`, and `USDC/USDT` pools by transaction time (according to the blockchain confirmation time) and calculate the time.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n###### 5. Can providing more liquidity value in Event 4 increase the number of tokens I receive?\n\nNo, in Event 4, we will distribute this portion of tokens equally among participants. As long as your liquidity value is equal to or greater than \\$100, you can share this reward equally.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n###### 6. Is there a minimum liquidity value requirement for participation in Event 5?\n\nThere is no minimum liquidity value requirement for Event 5. Any user who provides liquidity to the pool during this period can participate in Event 5. The number of tokens you ultimately receive will depend on your liquidity value and lock-up duration.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n###### 7. Will providing more liquidity value or longer lock-up periods in Event 5 result in more tokens?\n\nYes, a higher liquidity value or longer lock-up period will increase your final allocation weight.\n\nThe specific calculation is the \"liquidity value at the time of your provision\" multiplied by the corresponding multiplier.\n\nThe multiplier depends only on your lock-up duration, as shown in the table below:\n\n| Lock-up Duration | Multiplier |\n| ---------------- | ---------- |\n| 3 Months         | 2          |\n| 4 Months         | 3          |\n| 6 Months         | 6          |\n| 1 Year           | 10         |\n| 2 Years          | 20         |\n| 3 Years          | 30         |\n| 4 Years          | 40         |\n\nFor example:\n\n- User 1 provides 1,000 SUI tokens and 1,300 USDC tokens when the SUI price is \\$1.3 for the `SUI/USDC` pool. Their liquidity value is \\$2,600. User 1 chooses a 1-year lock-up, receiving a 10x boost multiplier. Their final token allocation weight is 2,600 * 10 = 26,000.\n- User 2 provides 1,000 SUI tokens and 1,000 USDC tokens when the SUI price is \\$1 for the `SUI/USDC` pool. Their liquidity value is \\$2,000. User 2 chooses a 3-month lock-up, receiving a 2x boost multiplier. Their final token allocation weight is 2,000 * 2 = 4,000.\n\nThis means that in the Event 5 token rewards, User 1 receives approximately 6.5 times more tokens than User 2 (26,000/4,000).\n\n> ##### Note: \n>\n> Please distinguish between the multiplier for this event and the \"liquidity boost\" displayed in the liquidity provision panel. \n>\n> Although both are used to multiply the provided liquidity value by a factor for weighted allocation of rewards to incentivize those who provide longer liquidity value duration, their purposes are different:\n>\n> 1. The former serves only as a coefficient for this event.\n> 2. The liquidity boost is a coefficient for liquidity mining after the event ends."},{"article":{"time":"2023-05-11","name":"suiswap-mainnet-launch","nameShow":"🌌· Suiswap Mainnet Launch","description":"We are thrilled to announce the launch of the Suiswap Mainnet, a major milestone in our journey towards a more efficient and equitable decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

Our vision is to provide a platform that leverages the power of SUI to give everyone, everywhere, equal access to financial services and empower the entire SUI ecosystems.\n\nSimultaneously with the mainnet launch, in order to encourage users to provide liquidity for our protocol. we will establish the \n\n1. [Initial SSWP liquidity pool](#1.-initial-sswp-token-liquidity-pool)\n2. [Initial liquidity reward event](/doc/suiswap/?section=suiswap&article=suiswap-initial-liquidity-reward)\n\nYou can participate in both activities to maximize your SSWP earnings.\n\n![suiswap-mainnet-launch-cover-no-title {height:200px} {width:100%}](/doc/cover/suiswap-mainnet-launch-cover-no-title.jpg)\n\n--------------------------\n\n## 1. Beacon SSWP Token Liquidity Pool\n\nUpon the launch of the Suiswap Mainnet, we will establish an initial liquidity pool for Suiswap's native token SSWP, namely `SSWP/SUI`, to facilitate a small portion of SSWP token circulation initially. \nThis liquidity will comprise about 1% of the total circulating tokens and will be sold at an initial price of 0.015 SUI per SSWP.\n\n- **This pool will first serve as a beacon for determining the price of our IDO public sale**. In subsequent IDO events, our selling price will be determined by the price of the `SSWP/SUI` pool.\n- At the same time, this portion of SSWP can enable users to experience all SSWP-based features, such as obtaining 60% of the platform dividend by staking SSWP tokens, and earning extra SSWP benefits by locking SSWP. As demonstrated in our test network, any user who purchases SSWP tokens via `SSWP/SUI` and completes the staking after the mainnet launch can receive 60% of the platform income dividend on the 14th day after the mainnet launch.\n\nThe `SSWP/SUI` liquidity pool adopts an automatic destruction mechanism. During the beacon stage, all of the transaction fee will be used to automatically purchase `SSWP` tokens and destroy them. \nThis will help reduce the token circulation in the long term and stabilize the price of the SSWP token.\n\n> ##### Why Can't I Add Liquidity to the SSWP/SUI pool ?\n>\n> During the beacon phase (before IDO launch), the `SSWP/SUI` liquidity pool mainly serves as an initial platform for users to purchase SSWP (or sell SSWP when appropriate), while also providing a market-determined reference price for the IDO.\n>\n> In this beacon phase (before the IDO launch), 1% of the liquidity is provided by the Suiswap Team. All transaction fees during this phase are used to buy SSWP from the `SSWP/SUI` pool and are permanently destroyed. As liquidity providers cannot earn transaction fees during this phase, we temporarily suspend user liquidity provision to the `SSWP/SUI` pool before the IDO launch. Of course, this does not affect your ability to trade through the `SSWP/SUI` pool.\n>\n> After the IDO, we will readjust the transaction fees for liquidity providers and reopen the liquidity of the SSWP/SUI pool.\n\n\n\n## 2. Initial Liquidity Reward Event\n\nWe will host an Initial Liquidity Rewards event that will last for two months. Any user who chooses to provide liquidity for more than three months in the **SUI/USDC, SUI/USDT, USDC/USDT** pools can share 400 million SSWP tokens evenly.\n\nFor more details, please visit this [link](/doc/suiswap/?section=suiswap&article=suiswap-initial-liquidity-reward) for event detail.\n\n---------------------\n\n## Not the End\n\nThe Suiswap Mainnet launch signifies a new chapter in our journey. It reflects our commitment to providing a platform that is not only user-friendly and efficient but also contributes to the broader DeFi ecosystem. We are grateful for the support of our community and look forward to continuing our journey together towards a more equitable financial future.\n\nStay tuned for more updates on the Suiswap Mainnet and thank you for your continued support!"},{"article":{"time":"2023-05-21","name":"suiswap-ido","nameShow":"⚫️· About Suiswap IDO","description":"Join us on 06/03 for the highly anticipated Suiswap IDO.
